Fortnite offers players a choice of three distinct modes: Fortnite: Save the World, an open-world co-op survival sim that challenges players to work together to fight off zombie-like monsters with weapons and various buildings; Fortnite: Battle Royale is a competitive battle royale mode in which 100 players must battle each other until only one is left alive; and, added in 2018, Fortnite: Creative, a sandbox mode in which players can create their own structures, similar to Minecraft. Fortnite: Save the World was released on Windows, macOS, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One platforms, while Fortnite: Battle Royale and Fortnite: Creative, in addition to the listed platforms, also on portable devices - Nintendo Switch, iOS and Android. The game is distributed mainly through digital distribution on a free-to-play model; Physical versions of the game are published by Gearbox Publishing.</p>
