      <p class="c1">Don't Starve is an action-adventure roguelike and survival video game developed and published by Canadian independent development team Klei Entertainment. The game was released on April 23, 2013 on the digital distribution platform Steam.The game has two game modes: survival and adventure (the mobile version of the game also has a free mode - this is an easier version of the game), however, only survival mode has direct access to the game. By choosing a character that has their own unique abilities, as well as setting up the world, the player can begin to survive. The character appears in an unspecified place, where he is met by Maxwell (in the Shipwrecked add-on, the player is met by a parrot with a pirate hat, in the Hamlet add-on - Chameleon), who advises to look for firewood. The goal of the game is to survive in a randomly assembled world for as long as possible. The player has three endings: death, transition to a new world, or saving Maxwell.</p>
